For your personal chat project using Next.js, here's a **recommended stack** that balances simplicity, scalability, and ease of implementation:

---

### **1. Authentication**
Use **NextAuth.js** (built for Next.js):
  - Supports Google/GitHub/Magic Link (email) authentication out of the box.
  - No need for a separate backend.
- **Firebase Auth** (if you prefer Googleâ€™s ecosystem).

---

### **2. Database : Firebase Firestore**:
- **Firebase Firestore** (NoSQL):
  - Real-time updates out of the box.
  - Simple to pair with Firebase Auth.

---

### **3. Real-Time Chat**
- **Supabase Realtime** or **Firebase Realtime Database**:
 
---

### **4. Backend**
Use **Next.js API Routes** for:
- Sending messages.
- Fetching chat history.
- Handling authentication logic (e.g., verifying users).

No need for a separate backend server.

---

### **5. Hosting**
- **Vercel** (optimized for Next.js, free tier).

---

### **Database Structure Example**
For Supabase/Firestore:
```plaintext
chats (
  id: string
  user1_id: string (your admin user ID)
  user2_id: string (the other user's ID)
  messages: array [
    { text: string, sender_id: string, timestamp: date }
  ]
)
```
- Ensure each chat is unique to a pair of users (you + one other user).
- Use database security rules to restrict access to the two participants.

---

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Authentication Setup**:
   - Configure NextAuth.js with Google/GitHub or email magic links.
   - Store user IDs in the database.

2. **Chat Logic**:
   - When a user logs in, check if a chat exists between them and your admin account. If not, create one.
   - All users can chat with admin only, not to each other.
   - There will be a chat box and all messages will be sent to admin
   - "mohit.patel1966@gmail.com" is the admin email account
   - when logged in with admin account, all chats will be shown and admin can message which is visible to related account only.
   - Use real-time subscriptions to sync messages between participants.

3. **UI**:
   - Build a simple chat interface with a message list and input field.
   - Show only the chat between the logged-in user and your admin account.

---

### **Why Not React?**
Stick with Next.js! It handles:
- Server-side rendering (SSR) for SEO (if needed).
- API routes (no separate backend).
- Easy deployment to Vercel.

### **Example Tools Summary**
| Category       | Tool               | Use Case                          |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Authentication | NextAuth.js        | Simple, Next.js-native sign-in    |
| Database       | Supabase           | Real-time + free tier             |
| Hosting        | Vercel             | Optimized for Next.js             |
